\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First I would like to thank Mr. TAEI Payman, Director of Operations and President of
Hindsite Interactive for allowing me to integrate this structure and have this unique
opportunity to realize my final degree project in the United States.
In particular I would like to thank Mr. TAEI for the confidence he granted to me to
lead the different projects I was affected to by considering me as an employee.
As my tutor I want to thank him for proposing me interesting, diversified and original
projects and tasks from a technical point of view. 

I especially enjoyed the autonomy
and responsibilities he entrusted me. But also follow-up, availability, advice and
criticism that enabled me to make progress and improve at the technical point of
view as well as methodological.
As well thank you to Mr. KHERADMAND Shayan, responsible of design who was
one of my co-worker and contact for all questions regarding the design. He was
always available and relevant in his answers.

I also would like to thank Mr. WEINZAPFAEL Pierre, ex-intern at Hindsite extending his
experience in the company for other six-months as a Web Developer. He was my
main co-worker and a precious help to understand the architecture and existing
code. Our mutual help allowed us to achieve a working project and a quick
progression of tasks.

Finally I thank all other employees of Hindsite at a distance or not for their patience
and help when needed.
