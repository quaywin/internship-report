\chapter{Conclusion}

\section*{Overview of the work achieved}

%During this internship I completed the realization of three add-ons (Flash Maker,
%Calendar and Carousel) as well as an administrator for current and further HTML
%add-ons.
%These add-ons were tested and approved by my tutor but in my opinion we need to
%take more time to test all configuration cases, especially since there are so many
%cases that we cannot reproduce.
%
%One thing that definitely remains to do is add more templates, more presets to these
%add-ons to provide to the user a lot more possibilities of customization and
%examples. This part concerns more the designers that need to imagine and create
%templates and a small intervention from developer to integrate these.
%
%We are also expecting to launch last version of Easy Web Content containing all new
%add-ons soon so we can have feedback from users.
%
%We also have a lot of ideas for new add-ons that should be easier to create since we
%now have all required bases.
%
%I am now staying at Hindsite six other months to go on with this project, form next
%interns to this system and manage all further developments in this project.
%
%As Easy Web Content is not live at the moment I’m writing these lines we do not
%have an idea of the revenues generated through my work but I already know that
%when next version will be launched we will propose users two different subscriptions:
%- Standard account type will grant access to already existing functionalities of
%Easy Web
%- A new “Complete” account will give a full almost unlimited access to all add-
%ons to the user
%
%This Complete account will be proposed at a price of \$24.95 a month whereas
%standard account is at \$9.95.
%As the Complete account added value is important we hope to generate good
%revenues from this subscription and expect many users to switch to this account.

\section*{Work and organization}

%I feel like my work was really useful because I could see the results of it.
%In the United States the hours of work per week are greater than in France (around
%40 hours) and I was mostly satisfied with the progression of my work.
%I was granted a lot of independency in the choice of technologies, implementation,
%methods and organization. I could always give my opinion and submit my ideas.
%In the other hand I think that we can still improve a lot the organization of the work at
%Hindsite.
%
%For example we do not have any Subversion (CVS) to work with and as we were at
%least two people working on shared resources this was always a pain to work with
%and it happen that we lose time because of that.
%This is a point that me and previous interns already talked about to Mr. Taei but
%because do not have access to the server configuration we cannot configure a SVN
%ourselves.
%
%Another improvement of organization would be to use a Bug Tracker tool; we are still
%working with shared documents to track bugs.
