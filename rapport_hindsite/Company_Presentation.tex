development and everything is done to facilitate usability. Most of the users are
novice.

their FTP server but also to add dynamic content to their pages as a music player, a calendar etc. Major possibilities of the software.

\begin{itemize}
\item Edition of all pages and content
\item Creation of web pages
\item Addition of interactive, dynamic content in Flash and/or HTML (all add-ons)
\item Security of pages with a login/password access

\section{Company Analyze}

Hindsite Interactive has a strategic geographic position, indeed Frederick is
located inside an agglomeration with a worldwide influence in the eastern
megalopolis of the USA and its main city New York City. This area is the
economical heart of the country and counts more than 55 million inhabitants.

It’s also one of the most influent in the world in the economical, financial,
political or even cultural aspects. All this favorites businesses of all kind and
especially requires new technologies and information systems (IT). As a
matter of fact, Hindsite Interactive occupies a central position that allows it to
answer quickly and efficiently to the customer needs.

Closer to Frederick, Washington DC is the capital of the USA and therefore
hosts thousands of federal institutions, organizations, law firms, medias,
consulting companies etc. Moreover the Washington area comprises
worldwide companies headquarters and some of the most famous universities
(e.g. Georgetown).

Hindsite knew how to take advantage of this heterogeneity by offering different
services and have client in all sectors. This non-specialization offers Hindsite
the ability to continue growing during the economical crisis.
In order to comply with the Business Model of the company, the philosophy is
to develop the interdisciplinary of competences and a quick adaptation to the
new technologies to answer the best to the client expectations.
